# Getting Started using Nuxt

## Setting up your environment

<Steps>

### Install the packages

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing nuxt-uploadthing
```

### Add env variables

```bash
NUXT_UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Initialize the Uploadthing module

```ts copy filename="nuxt.config.js"
export default {
  modules: ["nuxt"],
  uploadthing: {
    /**
     * Path to your router definition file
     * @default `~/server/uploadthing.ts`
     */
    routerPath: "",
  },
};
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="~/server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/h3";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (ev: H3Event) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const uploadRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ event }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(event);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

## Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs items={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
    <TailwindSetup />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
