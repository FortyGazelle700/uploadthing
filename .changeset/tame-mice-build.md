feat: add client headers option

this primarily allows you to authenticate the client when your server is deployed separate from your client:

```ts
import { genUploader } from "uploadthing/client";

const uploadFiles = genUploader<OurFileRouter>({
  url: "https://my-server.com",
});

uploadFiles("endpoint", {
  headers: async () => {
    const token = await getToken();
    return { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` };
  },
});
```
